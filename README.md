This script will hide some (hopefully most) of those annoying overlays that
pop up at the end of certain videos on Youtube. Note: it will NOT reliably 
hide ads that come up near the beginning of videos.

How to use it:

1. Go to the video you want to watch and open the console by pressing:
Cmd + Option + J (for Chrome on Mac)
Cmd + Option + K (for Firefox on Mac)
Ctrl + Shift + I (for Chrome on PC)
Ctrl + Shift + K (for Firefox on PC)
Ctrl + Shift + J (for Microsoft Edge on PC)

2. Paste in all the code in the JS file and hit Enter.

3. Then close the console again and watch your video in peace :)
